## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview:
This week, I focused on getting my project set up and establishing a foundation for my work. I researched and finalized my tech stack, ensuring that the tools and frameworks I’m using are appropriate for the project. I also started working on some initial design ideas, including early wireframes, and set up my GitHub repository. I created and merged my first PR from the dev branch to staging, ensuring the workflow is in place for future work.

🌵 Challenges:
One challenge I encountered was figuring out the GitHub workflow. At first, I wasn’t sure if I needed to create a staging branch or if I should just work with the dev branch. I addressed this by following the instructions and ensuring everything was properly set up, including making sure my PRs were pointing to the correct branches.

🏆 Accomplishments:
I successfully set up the GitHub workflow and repository, merged my first PR, and documented my tech stack and early design ideas. I also made progress on understanding the project requirements, which is crucial for moving forward.

🔮 Next Steps:
Next, I plan to refine my design work, start breaking down the features I need to build for the project, and begin working on my feature branches. I’ll also focus on pushing my updates regularly, tracking progress with issues, and working on finalizing the details of my design in preparation for the next milestone.

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
- Refactored the homepage of the Spendy application, focusing on improving the layout and styling for a cleaner and more user-friendly interface.

- Resized the logo and adjusted its responsiveness for different screen sizes.

- Created and tested feature branches for individual tasks, such as "Add navigation bar" and "Enhance homepage layout."

- Filed and managed GitHub issues related to research, development, and documentation.

- Opened pull requests for merging feature branches into the dev branch, ensuring a clear workflow for collaborative development.

🌵 Challenges: 
- Logo Scaling Issue: Initially, the logo was not resizing correctly despite CSS updates. This was addressed by specifying explicit width and height properties and testing responsiveness.

- Branch Management: Managing multiple feature branches was confusing at first, so I implemented a naming convention (e.g., feature/navbar, feature/homepage) and tracked progress using GitHub Project Boards.

- PR Coordination: Understanding when to merge branches required clarification, so I referred to GitHub documentation and instructor feedback for guidance.
  
🏆 Accomplishments: 

- Improved proficiency in Git workflows, particularly using feature branches and pull requests for better version control.

- Enhanced skills in responsive design by testing and refining the homepage layout for different devices.

- Gained a deeper understanding of managing GitHub issues, milestones, and project boards to track progress effectively.

🔮 Next Steps: 

- Implement a functional navigation bar for the homepage, ensuring it links to the appropriate sections or pages.

- Start integrating backend APIs to display dynamic content on the homepage.

- Research modern UI/UX trends to further improve the site's design and user experience.

- Document the current project setup and workflows in the docs folder for easier onboarding of collaborators.

### Week 3

⚙️ Overview
This week I focused on integrating user authentication using Auth0, including implementing login, logout, and protected routes. I also improved the UI/UX by creating a modular navigation component with better styling and user state awareness. Additionally, I started the groundwork for the financial features by building a basic expense tracker component with its own styles and functionality.

🌵 Challenges
I encountered some initial hurdles understanding how to protect routes and dynamically update navigation based on authentication state. Handling logout redirection and conditional rendering took some trial and error. To address these, I reviewed Auth0’s React SDK documentation, refactored the navigation into its own component, and thoroughly tested user flows to ensure seamless user experience.

🏆 Accomplishments
I leveled up my understanding of authentication flow in React apps with Auth0, including protected routes and UI state management for logged-in users. I also enhanced my CSS modularization skills by separating styles for navigation, homepage, and expense tracker components, improving maintainability and readability of the codebase.

🔮 Next Steps
Next, I plan to continue expanding financial features starting with the expense tracker — adding more functionality like editing and deleting expenses. I also want to enhance the UI/UX further by refining the homepage and footer components, plus integrate better error handling and user feedback in forms.

### Week 4

This week, I worked on finishing up the final touches with my Project called Spendy A Finance Budgeting App.

🌵 Challenges: One challenge that I faced this week was recording a video of everything I have done this past month. I was challenged by this because I struggle when it comes to speaking on camera whether its for a video or not.

🏆 Accomplishments: This week I accomplished feeling comfortable with everything I have done this past month in order to prepare me to start coding in the next Project & Portfolio class.

🔮 Next Steps: Next steps will be to get myself ready to code in Project & Portfolio 5 and make sure all my techstacks work out well with each other so I can have a seamless time coding.
