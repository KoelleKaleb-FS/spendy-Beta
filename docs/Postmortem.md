## ðŸ“¢ &nbsp; Postmortem

Accomplishments and Challenges (REFLECT): Highlight any progress made in this class. Did anything slow down your progression? How did you move forward?
[
Progress Made:
This month, I made significant strides in refining my understanding and application of GitHub workflows, feature branch development, and project management through milestones. I successfully implemented iterative improvements to my project, ensuring clean code practices, applying feedback, and maintaining a detailed commit history to showcase gradual enhancements.

Challenges Encountered:
One challenge I faced was ensuring seamless integration of features during the pull request process, as some conflicts arose due to simultaneous work on overlapping features. To address this, I established a more structured communication plan and improved issue tracking to minimize overlap.]

Month in Review (INQUIRE): What went well? What if anything would you do differently to improve on the work in progress? What advice do you have for future students?
[
What Went Well:

Adoption of Agile principles led to better organization and efficiency.
The iterative milestone workflow allowed for continuous feedback and adjustment.
Successfully managed feature branching, merging, and tracking issues using GitHub.

What Could Be Improved:

Better initial planning for feature dependencies could reduce merge conflicts.
Allocating more time for documentation updates during development would ensure smoother handoffs.

Advice for Future Students:

Start each milestone with a clear roadmap. Prioritize smaller, manageable tasks to avoid being overwhelmed, and always allocate time for reviewing and refining your workflow.]

Research and Analysis (SUGGEST): Briefly describe the independent study and research you conducted this past month. Highlight any resources you would like to recommend for this class and explain why it would be helpful.

[
Independent Study:
This month, I explored several GitHub and Agile resources to enhance project workflow. I also reviewed React and state management best practices to solidify my front-end development skills.

Recommended Resources:

"Pro Git" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub â€“ Provides a comprehensive guide to Git for version control.
Scrum.org's "Introduction to Agile" â€“ Explains Agile principles and their application in software development.
Kent C. Dodds' Articles on Clean Code â€“ Offers practical insights into writing maintainable code.
These resources are invaluable for mastering workflow processes and improving technical and organizational aspects of development.

Change Order and Next Steps (ELEVATE): At the beginning of the month you were asked to work on a Project Proposal and Tech Stack. Looking back at this past month, would you suggest any change to help move along the project? How will you continue to move forward?

[
Proposed Changes:
Looking back, I would suggest incorporating more robust dependency mapping early in the project to prevent bottlenecks. Additionally, automating deployment to staging environments could streamline the review process.

Next Steps:

Finalize all remaining features and ensure documentation is comprehensive.
Strengthen unit and integration testing to ensure project stability.
Maintain consistent updates to GitHub logs and project boards to track progress effectively.
By focusing on these steps, I aim to deliver a well-documented, high-quality project while adhering to Agile methodologies.
