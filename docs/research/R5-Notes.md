## Topic - API Design Principles

This document contains general notes related to API design, documentation practices, and breaking designs into reusable components.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - How to Design an API

Brief overview of research. Understanding the fundamentals of designing robust and user-friendly APIs.

- Key finding 1: Clear and consistent naming conventions improve the usability of an API.
- 2: Versioning the API ensures backward compatibility as it evolves.
- 3:Providing meaningful error messages helps developers troubleshoot efficiently.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 2 - Documentation Driven Development

Brief overview of research. Exploring how documentation-first approaches streamline development.

- Key finding 1: Writing documentation first clarifies the scope and functionality of the API before coding begins.
- 2: API documentation should include examples, error codes, and detailed explanations of endpoints.
- 3: Tools like Swagger or Postman can automate the generation of interactive API documentation.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 3 - Breaking Your Designs Down

Brief overview of research. Applying atomic design principles to create reusable and maintainable components in React applications.

- Key finding 1: Start with smaller, reusable components (atoms) and build up to larger components (molecules and organisms).
- 2: Organizing components this way improves scalability and consistency in design systems.
- 3: Atomic design principles make it easier to maintain and refactor React projects.
