# Research Document

## **Overview**

This research document outlines key findings and strategies to validate and strengthen ideas in development for the project. It focuses on user interaction, feature validation, and best practices for Agile planning.

## **The Story Behind Success**

Google’s case studies highlight several strategies to validate ideas effectively:

1. **User Feedback Loops**:

   - Collect regular feedback to refine the product incrementally.
   - Similar to our project, implementing surveys or feedback forms could ensure we're aligning with user expectations.

2. **Iterative Testing**:
   - Deploying smaller iterations of features for real-world testing.
   - We can implement this by prioritizing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and gradually enhancing functionality.

## **A/B Testing**

**Key Insights:**

- A/B Testing allows for comparing two versions of a feature to determine which performs better.
- Example: Testing two different designs for our primary user dashboard to identify which increases user engagement.

**Plan for Implementation:**

- Use tools like Google Optimize or custom analytics to track user interactions.
- Begin with small test groups to measure the impact of changes on user behavior.

## **Use Cases**

Effective use case documentation ensures our application meets user needs. Here’s a sample use case for our project:

1. **Use Case: Adding a New Budget Entry**

   - **Actor**: User
   - **Steps**:
     1. User logs into the application.
     2. Navigates to the "Add Entry" section.
     3. Inputs details (amount, category, date).
     4. Submits the form.
     5. Receives confirmation and sees the updated budget on the dashboard.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The entry is stored in the database and reflected in reports.

2. **Use Case: Reviewing Monthly Spending Trends**
   - **Actor**: User
   - **Steps**:
     1. User selects a time period from the dashboard.
     2. Views visualized spending data (charts and graphs).
     3. Identifies overspending trends.
   - **Expected Outcome**: User gains insights to improve financial habits.

## **Tools and Strategies**

1. **GitHub Project Board**:

   - Use for planning and tracking milestones, sprints, and issues.

2. **User Analytics**:

   - Integrate tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel to monitor user behavior.
   - Track key metrics such as session duration and feature usage.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Explore potential APIs for data visualization (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js) and budget calculations.

## **Next Steps**

1. Start A/B Testing plan development for the application dashboard.
2. Define additional use cases and test scenarios.
3. Implement analytics to measure MVP performance and iterate.
