## Topic - Design Theory

Design Theory in coding refers to the set of principles and concepts that guide developers in structuring and organizing their code, ensuring it is efficient, maintainable, reusable and easy to understand. Essebtially applying design thinking to the process of building software by considering the problem space, user needs, and potential future changes, rather than just writing code line-by-line.

## Sub-Topic 1 - Confirmshaming and Ethical Design

Brief overview of research.
Confirmshaming is a manipulative design practice where users are guilted into making a choice, often by framing the alternative in a negative or emotionally charged way. Ethical design opposes these practices, focusing instead on building trust and transparency.

- Key finding 1: Confirmshaming erodes user trust and can harm long-term engagement.
- 2: Ethical design fosters a positive relationship between users and platforms.
- 3: Using neutral and respectful language in design builds credibility.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Laws of UX and Application to Design

Brief overview of research.
The Laws of UX are principles that guide user experience design to ensure usability and satisfaction. These include ideas like Hick's Law (simplifying decision-making) and Fitts's Law (ease of target acquisition).

- Key finding 1: Simpler designs reduce cognitive load and improve usability.
- 2: Alignment with user expectations enhances perceived ease of use.
- 3: Consistent application of UX laws creates more predictable and intuitive experiences.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Space in Design and Layout Optimization

Brief overview of research.
Whitespace (or negative space) is a crucial design element that impacts readability, focus, and aesthetic appeal. Proper use of space ensures a clean and organized interface.

- Key finding 1: Whitespace improves content comprehension by reducing clutter.
- 2: Strategic spacing guides user attention to key elements.
- 3: Overcrowded designs can cause frustration and confusion.
